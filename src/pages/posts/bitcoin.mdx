Like most people, when I first got involved in crypto, I had bought all of my crypto through a centralised exchange. This is fine, but in light of the recent events at FTX.com I became a bit concerned with the safety of my bitcoin.

First let us understand the different types of bitcoin wallets. These wallet types actually hold for all of crypto but I want to be specific to bitcoin for this article.

## Custodial wallet ðŸ‘Ž

This is how most beginners to the space own their bitcoin. They own their bitcoin through some exchange (Coinbase, FTX, or Luno in South Africa) where the exchange or company holds the key to their wallet. This is analogous to having fiat money in a bank account in traditional finance.

## Self-custodial wallet ðŸ¥°

This is where you and only you know the key to your bitcoin wallet. The key is 256-bit string of numbers and letters. For most practical purposes you will not have to remember this 256-bit string but rather a seed phrase of 12 or 24 human-readable words. These words can be used to generate your unique 256-bit key. If you have a self-custodial wallet, then as long as you remember these words and keep them secret, your bitcoin is safe. This is analogous to having physical cash in traditional finance.

## Setting up your non-custodial wallet ðŸ’°

I decided to use bitcoin.com's wallet as my new self-custodial wallet as they have a slick user interface and provide lots of detail on how to set up your wallet with them.
Once you have downloaded the app from the app store (Google Play Store for Android), create an account or sign in with your Google or Apple account, I use this option and select my Google account.
Sign-in and select your bitcoin wallet. Then select the options menu and click on 'show my recovery phrase'.
You should then see your 12 word recovery phrase. Write this down on paper and keep it safe.

I deleted this wallet from my account as you do not want anyone to see your seed phrase.

## Transferring from custodial ðŸ’¸

I currently use Luno to buy bitcoin and thus I will show how to perform the process of moving your bitcoin to a non-custodial from their interface, however the process should be quite similar on other platforms.

First you will need to enable sending crypto from Luno's platform, which takes 24 hours to activate. Then you can go to your wallets and select your bitcoin wallet. Then click to send bitcoin and it will ask you to which address you want to send the bitcoin.

Go to your bitcoin.com app and copy the address of your bitcoin wallet in the bitcoin.com app and then go back to Luno.

Paste the address in and continue to send your bitcoin.
Initially I send a small amount of bitcoin and wait for it to reflect in my bitcoin.com wallet just to make sure that I am sending it to the correct address.

It is really that easy. You now have your bitcoin in a self-custodial wallet and you are safe from the evil corporations.
You can withdraw from the bitcoin.com wallet depending on your location and buy more bitcoin with your visa or mastercard card.
